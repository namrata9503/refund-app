# RefundApp + Angular

This is a project to demonstrate an app to add expense costs that fill in form and fetch data from given APIs with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.3.
.
## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
https://github.com/namrata9503/refund-app.git
cd refund-app
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```


### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, and runs on development mode.
* `npm run build` - build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory and sets up build for production.
* `npm run lint` - runs `eslint` on the project files.

These are the test-related scripts:

* `npm test` - builds the application and runs unit tests.
